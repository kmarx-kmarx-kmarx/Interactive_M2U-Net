# Interactive M2U-Net

This repo has the Interactive M2U-Net class for running training and inference using M2U-Net as well as two models for red blood cell segmentation. See `interactive_inference_demo.py` to see how to run inference. Note that your computer might not have enough RAM to load all the images at once; you may have to implement your own batching.
